# Steam-Recommender
Recommend new video games based of user data and other users with similar tastes

Our group will make a model that will take data and predict whether a game will do well. It
will use STEAMSPY API as a data source. We will use ML(scikit learn), pandas, postgress,
flask, and visualization will be a webpage (either HTML or Javascript) to work on it.
