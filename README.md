# Steam Review Predictor

Train a basic neural network on the data available from [Steam's own API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) and [steamspy API](https://steamspy.com/api.php) - an API service that stores data compiled from more complicated queries to Steam's API - and come up with predictions on whether games will have received mostly positive or negative reviews overall.  

## Data review

Before beginning, visualize the data several ways to try and eyeball if there are clusters or related variables.

## Data

 Used a modified version of a [scraper found on Github](https://github.com/nik-davis/steam-data-science-project) to collect data from both the Steam and Steamspy APIs on 10/22/2021
