# Steam-Recommender
Recommend new video games based of user data and other users with similar tastes

Our group will make a model that will take data and predict whether a game will do well. It
will use STEAMSPY API as a data source. We will scrape data from the STEAMSPY API such as critic score, game sales, genre, system requirements, tags for multiplayer, etc.
Using this data we will apply ML to predict whether a game will be successful or not as determine by either scores or sales.
We will then use Tableau to demonstrate our results.
We will use ML(scikit learn), pandas, postgress, and visualization using Tableau.
